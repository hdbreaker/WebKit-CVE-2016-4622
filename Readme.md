# Bug analysis of WebKit exploit CVE-2016-4622 (Slice ValueOf Fastpath)

I will be working on this repository until successful get a general understand of how works the WebKit Exploitation Primitives (addrof and fakeobj)

This repository contains all that is needed to reproduce the Saelo Phrack Paper:
http://www.phrack.org/papers/attacking_javascript_engines.html  

Folder Structure:

. Saelo-Exploit-CVE-2016-4622: The full exploit developed by Saelo
. Exploit: This folder will contain my exploit for this vulnerability
  . I added to this folder a poc.js file that contain the payload used as starting point (initial memory leak) by this exploit. You can run it in the following way: 
  
  ```
  cd WebKit-Bins/Debug
  export DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH=$(pwd)
  ./jsc ../../Exploit/poc-memleak.js

  Output:
  0.123,1.123,2.12199579146e-313,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
  ``` 

. WebKit-SRC-CVE-2016-4622: WebKit SRC in the vulnerable branch (320b1fc3f6f) to code review purposes.

. WebKit-Bins: 
    . Debug: JavaScriptCore Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64 Debug binary
    . ASAN:  JavaScriptCore Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64 Debug binary with Address Sanitizer
    . Both Binaries were built on VMWare - OSX 10.11 - XCode 7.3.2 and the folders contains all the files that allow JSC binary to run in almost any modern OSX installation (for debugging purposes)

I will be working to create my own exploit to this CVE, some good resources that can be help full for any one that will try the CVE Exploitation:
